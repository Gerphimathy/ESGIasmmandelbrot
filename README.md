# **About**:

This project is meant as a school project for assembly class.


## **Usage**:

<p>You can use this as a basis for your own mandelbrot project.<br>
However if you copy this project for your own assembly class project, we are in no way responsible if you get punished.</p>

<p>Use <bold>compileX11.sh</bold> to compile <bold>mandelbrot.asm</bold> if you make any changes to the source code.<br>
This project requires X11 library and therefore cannot be used on windows without installing some libraries first.
